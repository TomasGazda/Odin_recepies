    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A taco  is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling.

        They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles.
